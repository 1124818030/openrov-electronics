OpenROV-Electronics
===================

Electronics for OpenROV.  Include schematics and other diagrams

What
====

We are working on a Beaglebone cape to host the necessary electronics for OpenROV.  Initially, it will include an Atmega328 (basically an Arduino - and programmed as such), a power protection circuit, and a few other power management features.

We'd like to support the open-source community as best we can, but we'd also like to support industry.  Therefore, we are including both Eagle and Fritzing versions of the schematics.  We may also move into a web hosted version to allow realtime collaboration in-browser.
